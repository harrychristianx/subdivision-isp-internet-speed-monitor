## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-speed-monitor.git
   cd network-speed-monitor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Mapbox token:

## Deployment

This application can be easily deployed to Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyourusername%2Fnetwork-speed-monitor)

For other deployment options, build the application first:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Then start the production server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Customization

### Adding More Services to Monitor

Edit the `SERVICES` object in `src/app/api/speedtest/route.js` to add more services:

```javascript
const SERVICES = {
  social: [
    // Existing services...
    { name: 'LinkedIn', host: 'linkedin.com' },
  ],
  games: [
    // Existing services...
    { name: 'Nintendo', host: 'nintendo.com' },
  ],
  // Add new categories
  streaming: [
    { name: 'Netflix', host: 'netflix.com' },
    { name: 'Disney+', host: 'disneyplus.com' },
  ]
};
```

### Changing Test Frequency

To change how often tests run, modify the interval in `src/components/SpeedTestScheduler.js`:

```javascript
// Change 15 * 60 * 1000 (15 minutes) to your desired interval in milliseconds
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  runSpeedTest();
}, 15 * 60 * 1000);
```

## Technical Details

This application is built with:

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for beautiful UI elements
- **Recharts**: Composable charting library for React
- **Mapbox GL**: Interactive, customizable maps
- **SWR**: React Hooks for data fetching
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

## Privacy Considerations

This application:
- Only stores speed test data in memory (or your chosen database if configured)
- Displays approximate network location, not your exact physical location
- Does not share your data with third parties
